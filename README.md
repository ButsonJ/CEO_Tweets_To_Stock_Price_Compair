# CEO_Tweets_To_Stock_Price_Compair
Compairs the tweets of a CEO to the stock price, this was for an old hackathon I did in 2020 but am just migrating it over from an old dead github account now. 

Lost the original ReadMe file, but it was built using flask, Javascript, ChartsJS and CSS. Leave a message and I can add the deployment iff required.
